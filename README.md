# DocLink

“DocLink” – an interconnected P2P networking framework between health experts/professionals and global citizens.

Getting access to reliable information can be tedious especially through internet, where users can put up any sort of information despite the fact of it being true. So, this project is a common platform to bridge the gap between health experts/professionals and their respective beneficiaries.

Problem Domains: People are not able to get proper information on the experts they are seeking for. Even if people acquire information, it may not be reliable. People cannot easily contact the professionals. People have a problem choosing the best expert on the respective sector. Many platforms like Facebook and LinkedIn do provide information and connect users but Facebook can be too general to get accurate information, and LinkedIn can be complex for people who are not familiar to it. So, the current information technology infrastructure is not convenient for all type of users.

Aims: The aim of this project is to create a state-of-the-art webapp that facilitates an interconnected P2P networking framework between health experts/doctors and global citizens.

Deliverables and Objectives: The objectives of this system are: One stop solution: To connect experts/professionals of various category with their respective beneficiaries in a single platform. Provide portfolios for users to share personal information. To give users with the best alternative solution of getting information and contacting any professionals/experts of their choice and need.
